# Hi there!
I am **Dhruv Kapadia**. I am a student at the University of Illinois, going into my second year of studying Computer Science. I have been creating since I was a kid, and love learning about new topics in computing. I have developed a range of projects from a Solana based API protocol, to an AI-powered engine to analyze the similarities between songs. My expertise and interests lie between generative and modern AIs, and crypography powered technologies. I am passionate about building projects and developing tools for people to use around the world.
